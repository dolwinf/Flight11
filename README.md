# Flight11

For my first project, i choose to create an Online Travel Agency using **JQUERY** in the frontend.

The aim of the project was to use JQUERY to consume different APIs.

Apart from front-end logic, one of the challenges of the project was understanding the business, how travel agencies work.

Two main APIs used in the project are : 
* kiwi.com API 
* aviation-edge API
